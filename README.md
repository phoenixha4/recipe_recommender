# Vegan Recipe Recommender

This project is a Vegan Recipe Recommender system that provides recipe recommendations based on user preferences and/or input ingredients. The recommender system is built using Python and utilizes the Streamlit framework for the user interface.

## Features

- **User-Specific Recommendations**: The system generates recipe recommendations tailored to each user's preferences based on their liked recipes and past searches.
- **Ingredient-Based Recommendations**: Users can input ingredients, and the system will recommend recipes that best match those ingredients.
- **Combined Recommendations**: Users can input both their user ID and ingredients to receive recommendations based on their preferences and the provided ingredients.
- **User Profile Display**: The system displays the user's profile, including their liked recipes and past searches.
